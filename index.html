                                We chose the biological database PubMed, where each entry is a paper. We chose this database because it contains a variety of published papers regarding biotech research, 
                                and as such can be considered a biological database. Here, we use <b>biology</b> to mean the scientific study of living organisms.

                                Our criteria for determining similarity is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number </a>
                                used to describe the connectedness of authors of mathematical publications. While the Erdos number measures the degree of separation between human actors based on the undirected relationship of co-authorship, we measure the distance in terms of citations between papers in the same database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We propose that the distance between papers in the same database can be computed by building a directed graph G = (V, E), where every vertex v &isin; V represents one of the <i>n</i> papers in the database. For each citation from a paper <i>p</i> to another paper <i>q</i> in the same database, assign a single directed edge <i>e<sub>pq</sub></i> from a corresponding vertex <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> to a vertex <i>v<sub>q</sub></i> in <i>G</i>.
                            </p>
                        	<p>
		                        We can represent the edges between each of the vertices representing the <i>n</i> papers in a database using an adjacency matrix. Below is an example illustration:
		                        <br>

                                <br>
                            For two papers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to be considered <b>closely related</b>, there must be a path from the vertex corresponding to <i>p</i> to the one that corresponds to <i>q</i>. We define <b>distance</b> to be the shortest path from one vertex to another, where each edge has a uniform path cost of 1.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The two entries we chose are:
                            <br>
                                Paper 1: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375009/"> KB-Rank: efficient protein structure and functional annotation identification via text query. </a>
                                <br> 
                                Paper 2: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21082424"> Protein bioinformatics databases and resources. </a>

                                <br> 
                                The second paper is referenced by the first, thus the distance is 1.
                            </p>    
				            <p>
				                Below is a graph of the path between these two papers:

				            <p>
					            Since there is a path of length only 1 between these two papers, they are closely related.

                                In a 3-D backbone structure, the protein design problem determines the optimal sequence of <i>n</i> rotamers (discretized protein side chains) that satisfies physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints. This involves calculating the GMEC, global minimum energy conformation, by finding the sequence that minimizes the objective function representing the total energy. This is done by using a search graph over the conformational space. Current solutions have fallen into two groups: ones which approximate the GMEC, but can be trapped in local energy minimas and lead to a poor final solution; and ones that provide an exact solution, such as A*, but whose search spaces are too large. This 2016 paper from <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>, the journal of <i>Recomb</i>, proposes a modified AND/OR branch-and-bound search algorithm which solves the problem by getting rid of the rotamers known not to be part of the optimal solution. AND/OR is a search algorithm performed on a rooted tree that alternates between OR and AND nodes. Each OR node branches into different options represented by AND nodes, and each AND node branches into different possible outcomes as represented by OR nodes. The solution is a conditional plan, represented as a subtree that begins at the root, selects one AND child from each OR node, and includes every AND node's OR child that results in a goal leaf (Russell and Norvig 136-7). For this paper, each child node from an OR node specifies a rotamer from the residue. Each AND node branches into subspaces which represent separate residue total energies. The lowest energy conformation is determined suboptimally for an individual branch. and a global minimum energy is maintained based on the branches explored so far. The search proceedsdepth-first, requiring only <i>n</i> mutable residues to be kept in memory at a time. If the minimum energy for a branch is greater than the temporary estimate kept for the global minimum energy, that part of the search space is pruned. The solution subtree represents a valid conformation. One combinatorial algorithm that can be applied to this kind of tree is bucket elimination, in which each node <i>c</i> that represents a rotamer would store the lower bound on the energy of its subtree, assuming the rotamers that are <i>c</i>'s ancestors in the tree representation. Whereas this requires some nodes to store large energy tables, using a mini-bucket heuristic, through an algorithm that approximates bucket elmination, reduces the storage per node by allowing some of these energy tables to be broken up and split across two different nodes. The algorithm was tested to be both space- and time-efficient in minimizing the energy conformation compared with other existing algorithms.

                                This was an interesting example of applying artificial intelligence to a biological problem. It incorporates a complete pipeline of mapping biological concepts onto a mathematical problem, surveying algorithmic solutions of varying complexities, discussing the mathematical complexity, making experimental verifications on biological data, and including additional computer hardware considerations. The end of the paper identifies opportunities for other researchers to speed up the run time even more and estimate bigger proteins by adding parallel processors. Providing the groundwork for future development is a strength.

                                However, as much of the argument depends on the relative complexity of their solution to other proposed methods, some necessary statistics about the operating space and time of other techniques are missing from the real biological experiment. The authors could strengthen their argument by going more precisely into the estimated run times of these existing techniques.

                                If we were to present this paper to the class, we may give the class some additional background on some of the search algorithms discussed. However, we have already begun to develop a different project idea.
