                                We chose the biological database PubMed, where each entry is a paper. We chose this database because it contains a variety of published papers regarding biotech research, 
                                and as such can be considered a biological database. Here, we use <b>biology</b> to mean the scientific study of living organisms.

                            <p> 
                                Our criteria for determining similarity is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number </a>
                                used to describe the connectedness of authors of mathematical publications. While the Erdos number measures the degree of separation between human actors based on the undirected relationship of co-authorship, we measure the distance in terms of citations between papers in the same database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We propose that the distance between papers in the same database can be computed by building a directed graph G = (V, E), where every vertex v &isin; V represents one of the <i>n</i> papers in the database. For each citation from a paper <i>p</i> to another paper <i>q</i> in the same database, assign a single directed edge <i>e<sub>pq</sub></i> from a corresponding vertex <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> to a vertex <i>v<sub>q</sub></i> in <i>G</i>.
                            </p>
                        	<p>
		                        We can represent the edges between each of the vertices representing the <i>n</i> papers in a database using an adjacency matrix. Below is an example illustration:

                                <br>
                            For two papers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to be considered <b>closely related</b>, there must be a path from the vertex corresponding to <i>p</i> to the one that corresponds to <i>q</i>. We define <b>distance</b> to be the shortest path from one vertex to another, where each edge has a uniform path cost of 1.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The two entries we chose are:
                            <br>

                                The second paper is referenced by the first, thus the distance is 1.

                                In a 3-D backbone structure, the protein design problem determines the optimal sequence of <i>n</i> rotamers (discretized protein side chains) that satisfies physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints. This involves calculating the GMEC, global minimum energy conformation, by finding the sequence that minimizes the objective function representing the total energy. This is done by using a search graph over the conformational space. Current solutions have fallen into two groups: ones which approximate the GMEC, but can be trapped in local energy minimas and lead to a poor final solution; and ones that provide an exact solution, such as A*, but whose search spaces are too large. This 2016 paper from <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>, the journal of <i>Recomb</i>, proposes a modified AND/OR branch-and-bound search algorithm which solves the problem by getting rid of the rotamers known not to be part of the optimal solution. AND/OR is a search algorithm performed on a rooted tree that alternates between OR and AND nodes. Each OR node branches into different options represented by AND nodes, and each AND node branches into different possible outcomes as represented by OR nodes. The solution is a conditional plan, represented as a subtree that begins at the root, selects one AND child from each OR node, and includes every AND node's OR child that results in a goal leaf [1]. For this paper, each child node from an OR node specifies a rotamer from the residue. Each AND node branches into subspaces which represent separate residue total energies. The lowest energy conformation is determined suboptimally for an individual branch, and a global minimum energy is maintained based on the branches explored so far. The search proceeds depth-first, requiring only <i>n</i> mutable residues to be kept in memory at a time. If the minimum energy for a branch is greater than the temporary value kept for the global minimum energy, that part of the search space is pruned. The solution subtree represents a valid conformation. One combinatorial algorithm that can be applied to this kind of tree is bucket elimination, in which each node <i>c</i> that represents a rotamer would store the lower bound on the energy of its subtree, assuming the rotamers that are <i>c</i>'s ancestors in the tree representation. However, this requires some nodes to store large energy tables. Using a mini-bucket heuristic, through an algorithm that approximates bucket elimination, reduces the storage per node by allowing some of these energy tables to be broken up and split across two different nodes. Breaking the energy down to finer levels speeds up the heuristic so that larger trees can be processed. The algorithm was tested to be both space- and time-efficient in minimizing the energy conformation compared with other existing algorithms.

                                This was an interesting example of applying artificial intelligence to a biological problem. It incorporates a complete pipeline of mapping biological concepts onto a mathematical problem, surveying algorithmic solutions of varying complexities, discussing the mathematical complexity, making experimental verifications on biological data, and including additional computer hardware considerations. The end of the paper identifies opportunities for other researchers to speed up the run time even more and estimate bigger proteins by adding parallel processors. Providing the groundwork for future development is a strength.

                                However, as much of the argument depends on the relative complexity of their solution to other proposed methods, some necessary statistics about the operating space and time of other techniques are missing from the real biological experiment. The authors could strengthen their argument by going more precisely into the estimated run times of these existing techniques.

                                If we were to present this paper to the class, we may expand more on the other algorithms referenced in the paper. However, we have already begun to develop a different project idea.

    Social network analysis is concerned with actors, as represented by nodes in a graph, and the communities, or subgraphs, that they are a part of. A community is a subset of these nodes with frequent interactions with each other [1]. One measure of prominence of actors in a network is centrality, which characterizes the number of edges that a node participates in. In brain networks, a hub is a node that participates in many interactions or can be demonstrated to exhibit centrality by participating in many paths [2]. In addition to nodes, edges can also exhibit centrality, which can be used to determine modularity. Existing research has shown that if brain damage, injury, disease or trauma causes edges or nodes to be removed, the more central these components are, the worse the implications may be for the rest of the brain.

                                Existing research has applied graph theory to resting-state fMRI-based functional networks and discovered disruptions in these network for patients with Alzheimer’s and anxiety [3,4]. Anxiety is a disorder with significant costs to professional and academic productivity [5]. Due to an overactive limbic system and problems in emotion regulation, sufferers of social anxiety have a heightened response to threat, as shown through negative thought patterns [6]. Studies have shown that social anxiety patients are more easily affected by the influence of negative images and often have difficulty down-regulating their negative emotions [7]. However, not a lot of network evidence has been found to support these observations. In addition, not many studies have been done on task performance, and on evaluating the network alteration during the task.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, we will examine two groups of demographically matched healthy and social anxiety patients’ brain network data during emotion regulation tasks. We will look at how the two groups performed throughout the entire task, to see if there are any alterations or differences between the groups. The participants have been asked to view one of two types of images: images with no emotional stimulators (landscape, everyday activities etc.), or images with negative emotional stimulators (disasters, accidents etc.). Upon being shown an image that corresponds to a negative emotion, participants have been asked to either maintain their negative feelings, or try to reduce sad feelings by re-interpreting the image. 
                            </p>

                                A 34*34 symetrical matrix can be generated based on one EEG task senario for each subject (see Figure 1 for example). 34 corresponds to the number of recording electrodes and each index is the strength of connection between two channels (ranging from 0 to 1). Therefore, every matrix can be converted into an undirected, weighted graph (see Figure 2 for an example graph representation for two selected electrodes). All the data were collected from the Mood and Anxiety Research Program at UIC; subjects' label and information have been erased under IRB protocol. 
                            <p>
                                We will make core graphs based on the electrode locations. In order to visualize the network, we plan to employ a chord diagram, which has commonly been used for network analysis and has numerous libraries which support it [8]. Once we convert the data into a graph representation, we will run the modularity-based community detection algorithm, which is an algorithm based around edge centrality. This optimization algorithm maximizes differences between groups of nodes. By rearranging groups based on community assignments, we can develop a before and after graph.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking into the graph properties during these tasks will provide more insight into the overall network differences in emotion and cognitive processing of social anxiety patients. In addition, standard statistics will be applied to find out if differences in the underlying graph properties suggest a group difference or a task difference. As a result, we can see if the brain networks form grouping patterns when they engaging in different tasks, and if the social anxiety sickness makes a difference.
