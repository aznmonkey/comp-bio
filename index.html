                                We chose the biological database PubMed, where each entry is a paper. We chose this database because it contains a variety of published papers regarding biotech research, 
                                and as such can be considered a biological database. Here, we use <b>biology</b> to mean the scientific study of living organisms.

                            <p> 
                                Our criteria for determining similarity is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number </a>
                                used to describe the connectedness of authors of mathematical publications. While the Erdos number measures the degree of separation between human actors based on the undirected relationship of co-authorship, we measure the distance in terms of citations between papers in the same database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We propose that the distance between papers in the same database can be computed by building a directed graph G = (V, E), where every vertex v &isin; V represents one of the <i>n</i> papers in the database. For each citation from a paper <i>p</i> to another paper <i>q</i> in the same database, assign a single directed edge <i>e<sub>pq</sub></i> from a corresponding vertex <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> to a vertex <i>v<sub>q</sub></i> in <i>G</i>.
                            </p>
                        	<p>
		                        We can represent the edges between each of the vertices representing the <i>n</i> papers in a database using an adjacency matrix. Below is an example illustration:

                                <br>
                            For two papers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to be considered <b>closely related</b>, there must be a path from the vertex corresponding to <i>p</i> to the one that corresponds to <i>q</i>. We define <b>distance</b> to be the shortest path from one vertex to another, where each edge has a uniform path cost of 1.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The two entries we chose are:

                                The second paper is referenced by the first, thus the distance is 1.

                                In a 3-D backbone structure, the protein design problem determines the optimal sequence of <i>n</i> rotamers (discretized protein side chains) that satisfies physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints. This involves calculating the GMEC, global minimum energy conformation, by finding the sequence that minimizes the objective function representing the total energy. This is done by using a search graph over the conformational space. Current solutions have fallen into two groups: ones which approximate the GMEC, but can be trapped in local energy minimas and lead to a poor final solution; and ones that provide an exact solution, such as A*, but whose search spaces are too large. This 2016 paper from <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>, the journal of <i>Recomb</i>, proposes a modified AND/OR branch-and-bound search algorithm which solves the problem by getting rid of the rotamers known not to be part of the optimal solution. AND/OR is a search algorithm performed on a rooted tree that alternates between OR and AND nodes. Each OR node branches into different options represented by AND nodes, and each AND node branches into different possible outcomes as represented by OR nodes. The solution is a conditional plan, represented as a subtree that begins at the root, selects one AND child from each OR node, and includes every AND node's OR child that results in a goal leaf [1]. For this paper, each child node from an OR node specifies a rotamer from the residue. Each AND node branches into subspaces which represent separate residue total energies. The lowest energy conformation is determined suboptimally for an individual branch, and a global minimum energy is maintained based on the branches explored so far. The search proceeds depth-first, requiring only <i>n</i> mutable residues to be kept in memory at a time. If the minimum energy for a branch is greater than the temporary value kept for the global minimum energy, that part of the search space is pruned. The solution subtree represents a valid conformation. One combinatorial algorithm that can be applied to this kind of tree is bucket elimination, in which each node <i>c</i> that represents a rotamer would store the lower bound on the energy of its subtree, assuming the rotamers that are <i>c</i>'s ancestors in the tree representation. However, this requires some nodes to store large energy tables. Using a mini-bucket heuristic, through an algorithm that approximates bucket elimination, reduces the storage per node by allowing some of these energy tables to be broken up and split across two different nodes. Breaking the energy down to finer levels speeds up the heuristic so that larger trees can be processed. The algorithm was tested to be both space- and time-efficient in minimizing the energy conformation compared with other existing algorithms.

                                This was an interesting example of applying artificial intelligence to a biological problem. It incorporates a complete pipeline of mapping biological concepts onto a mathematical problem, surveying algorithmic solutions of varying complexities, discussing the mathematical complexity, making experimental verifications on biological data, and including additional computer hardware considerations. The end of the paper identifies opportunities for other researchers to speed up the run time even more and estimate bigger proteins by adding parallel processors. Providing the groundwork for future development is a strength.

                                However, as much of the argument depends on the relative complexity of their solution to other proposed methods, some necessary statistics about the operating space and time of other techniques are missing from the real biological experiment. The authors could strengthen their argument by going more precisely into the estimated run times of these existing techniques.

                                Anxiety is a disorder with significant costs to professional and academic productivity [1]. Due to an overactive limbic system and problems in emotion regulation, sufferers of social anxiety have a heightened response to threat, as shown through negative thought patterns [2]. Sufferers of social anxiety disorder show stronger connections in the left amygdala than healthy controls do. Studies have shown that social anxiety patients are more easily affected by negative images and struggle to down-regulate negative emotions [3]. Graph theory has discovered disruptions in resting-state fMRI-based functional networks in anxiety patients [4]. However, not many studies have been done on task performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using data collected by the Mood and Anxiety Research Program under Dr. Heidi Klumpp at UIC, we will examine the brain networks of demographically matched healthy and social anxiety patients during emotion regulation tasks. The participants were asked to view one of two types of images: ones with no emotional stimulators (landscape, everyday activities, etc.), or ones with negative emotional stimulators (disasters, accidents, etc.). The test subjects were asked to fill out a questionnaire prior to the research to make sure the pictures did not contain anything that could trigger a specific phobia. Upon being shown an image that corresponds to a negative emotion, participants were asked to either maintain their negative emotions, or try to reduce their negative emotions by re-interpreting the image. We will see if there are any alterations in either group's brain behaviors across the time interval of the task, and whether these alterations are different between the groups. We acknowledge that performance anxiety may limit the representativeness of the information collected about the subjects when viewing the neutral pictures. The subjects' label and information have been erased under IRB protocol [2].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To restrict the number of variables under consideration for the scope of the proposed timeline, we will not consider the time dimension or dynamic network principals from this data set. Our first step wll be to reduce the data to a 34*34 symmetrical matrix for one EEG task senario per test subject (see Figure 1 for example). 34 corresponds to the number of recording electrodes and each index is the strength of connection between two channels (ranging from 0 to 1). Each subject's matrix is averaged over a 5-minute recording in which they viewed 20+ images, so the effects of any image that could have triggered exceptional responses are smoothed out. Every matrix can be converted into an undirected, weighted graph (see Figure 2 for an example graph representation of two selected electrodes).

                                In order to visualize the network, we will make chord graphs based on the electrode locations, both before and after each set of tasks, for each of the groups. The chord diagram has commonly been used for network analysis and has numerous libraries to support it [5]. We will investigate network differences in the brain between the before and after graphs due to the negative emotion task versus the neutral emotion task, for the sick patients versus the control group. Our goal is to see whether running existing techniques on this particular data set will suggest insights consistent with or different from previous findings. We know there will some differences in the behaviors of the two test groups, but knowing how they perform differently on a network level will provide more insight into the neural activation of SAD patients, which will be meaningful for future treatment.

                                Network analysis is concerned with the nodes on a graph, and the communities, or subgraphs, they belong to [6]. A community -- or as we think of them for the brain, module -- is a subset of nodes with more links to each other than to nodes in other communities [7]. Community identification can be considered a form of unsupervised learning, or clustering. Existing research has developed algorithms to identify communities by optimizing the distance between different modules. We hypothesize that modularity will be the graph property that stands out as being different between the sick patients and the control group. If that is the case, we will run the Newman modularity-based community detection algorithm on the before and after graphs. This algorithm has been shown to perform better than some other methods, and is appropriate for graphs with a smaller number of nodes. We will use a Python library called <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a>  [8]. Our immediate next steps are to better understand the capabilities of this library, and better understand the Newman paper [9], to figure out how to use the library to run the algorithm. We believe these steps will be non-trivial.

                            <p>
                                If the data does not turn out to suggest clear modules, we may also select from other graph properties to analyze such as betweenness, clustering coefficient, average path length, network efficiency, etc. Depending on the parameter that is relevant to the data, we may run standard statistical tests such as the t-test in R to test whether the graph properties suggest group differences, and two-way ANOVA to investigate the task-group interaction. As a result, we will see whether social anxiety makes a difference in the grouping patterns formed in brain networks engaged under different tasks. Looking into these graph properties for the brain under the tasks will provide more insight into the overall network differences in emotion and cognitive processing of social anxiety patients.

                            Issues in the connectivity of the frontal cortex, which plays a role in perceiving what is going on in other people’s minds, at rest may lead to deficits in social perception [1].

                            <b>Edge and Node Properties as Applied to the Brain</b>
                            <br>
                            Network analysis is concerned with the prominence of actors in a network, as represented by nodes. One such measure of prominence is centrality, which characterizes the number of edges that a node participates in [2]. In management research, for example, social network analysis is used to determine which actors are central enough to an organization that losing them could be detrimental [3].
A node is said to have betweenness centrality relative to two other nodes if it is on a path between those nodes. In brain networks, a hub is a node that participates in many interactions or can be demonstrated to exhibit betweenness by participating in many paths. In addition to nodes, edges can also exhibit betweenness, which can be used to determine modularity [3]. Analysis of centrality can let us know which edges or nodes could cause problems if they are deleted.

<b>Community Properties as Applied to the Brain</b>
<br>
A community -- or as we think of them for the brain, module -- is a subset of nodes that interacts more frequently with each other than with others [4]. Community identification could be considered a form of unsupervised learning, or clustering. The nodes within a community should be close together, while nodes from different communities should be as far apart as possible. Existing research has developed algorithms to identify communities by optimizing the distance between different modules [5]. Trying to minimize the number of communities identified in a network is NP-hard, so there are approximations such as the generalized Louvain algorithm, a modularity-based community detection algorithm based around edge centrality. The Louvain algorithm ranks edges by their tendency to send information throughout the network. More formally, it ranks each edge by its k-path centrality, which is the sum of the proportions of times that messages cross through that edge [6].
