                                We chose the biological database PubMed, where each entry is a paper. We chose this database because it contains a variety of published papers regarding biotech research, 
                                and as such can be considered a biological database. Here, we use <b>biology</b> to mean the scientific study of living organisms.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Our criteria for determining similarity is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number </a>
                                used to describe the connectedness of authors of mathematical publications. While the Erdos number measures the degree of separation between human actors based on the undirected relationship of co-authorship, we measure the distance in terms of citations between papers in the same database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We propose that the distance between papers in the same database can be computed by building a directed graph G = (V, E), where every vertex v &isin; V represents one of the <i>n</i> papers in the database. For each citation from a paper <i>p</i> to another paper <i>q</i> in the same database, assign a single directed edge <i>e<sub>pq</sub></i> from a corresponding vertex <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> to a vertex <i>v<sub>q</sub></i> in <i>G</i>.
                            </p>
                        	<p>
		                        We can represent the edges between each of the vertices representing the <i>n</i> papers in a database using an adjacency matrix. Below is an example illustration:
		                        <br>

                                <br>
                            For two papers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to be considered <b>closely related</b>, there must be a path from the vertex corresponding to <i>p</i> to the one that corresponds to <i>q</i>. We define <b>distance</b> to be the shortest path from one vertex to another, where each edge has a uniform path cost of 1.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The two entries we chose are:
                            <br>
                                Paper 1: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375009/"> KB-Rank: efficient protein structure and functional annotation identification via text query. </a>
                                <br> 
                                Paper 2: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21082424"> Protein bioinformatics databases and resources. </a>

                                <br> 
                                The second paper is referenced by the first, thus the distance is 1.
                            </p>

					            Since there is a path of length only 1 between these two papers, they are closely related.

<p>Summary and Discussion of “Computational Protein Design Using AND/OR Branch-and-Bound Search” by YICHAO ZHOU, YUEXIN WU, and JIANYANG ZENG

<p>In a 3-D backbone structure, the protein design problem determines the optimal sequence of rotamers (discretized protein side chains) that satisfies the physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints. This involves computing the GMEC, global minimum energy conformation, the solution of an amino acid sequence that minimizes the objective function ET(r) =E0+i=1nE1(ri)+i=1nj=i+1nE1(ri,rj) , where ET(r) is the total energy and the parameter is rotamer assignment. In this 2016 paper from Journal of Computational Biology, the journal of Recomb, the proposed graph theoretic solution branches on conformational subspaces in AND/OR search. Current heuristic (as GMEC is a NP-hard problem) solutions have fallen into two groups: ones which approximate the GMEC, but can be trapped in local energy minimas and lead to a poor final solution; and ones that provide an exact solution, such as A*, but whose search spaces are too large. This paper solves the problem by getting rid of the rotamers known not to be part of the optimal solution. This prunes the search space and produces a modified AND/OR branch and bound search algorithm. The lowest energy conformation is determined suboptimally for each branch, and identified globally from these branches. Only the n mutable residues need to be kept in memory because the search is depth-first. The algorithm was tested to be both space- and time-efficient in minimizing the energy conformation compared with other existing algorithms.

	<p>
		This was an interesting example of applying artificial intelligence to a biological problem. It incorporates a complete pipeline of mapping biological concepts onto a mathematical problem, surveying algorithmic solutions of varying complexities, discussing the mathematical complexity, making experimental verifications on biological data, and including additional computer hardware considerations. Furthermore, The end of the paper identifies it has potential opportunities for other researchers to accelerate speed up the run time even more and to estimate larger bigger proteins by adding parallel processors. Providing the groundwork for future development is a strength.
However, aAs much as the argument depends on comparing the relative complexity of their solution to other proposed methods, some necessary statistics of about the operating space and time of other techniques are missing from the real biological experiment. perhaps tThe authors could have strengthened their argument by going more precisely into the estimated run times of these existing techniques.
	<p>If we were to present this paper to the class, we may give the class some additional background on some of the search algorithms discussed. However, we have already begun to develop a different project idea.
