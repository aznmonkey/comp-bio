                                We chose the biological database PubMed, where each entry is a paper. We chose this database because it contains a variety of published papers regarding biotech research, 
                                and as such can be considered a biological database. Here, we use <b>biology</b> to mean the scientific study of living organisms.

                            <p> 
                                Our criteria for determining similarity is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos number </a>
                                used to describe the connectedness of authors of mathematical publications. While the Erdos number measures the degree of separation between human actors based on the undirected relationship of co-authorship, we measure the distance in terms of citations between papers in the same database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We propose that the distance between papers in the same database can be computed by building a directed graph G = (V, E), where every vertex v &isin; V represents one of the <i>n</i> papers in the database. For each citation from a paper <i>p</i> to another paper <i>q</i> in the same database, assign a single directed edge <i>e<sub>pq</sub></i> from a corresponding vertex <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> to a vertex <i>v<sub>q</sub></i> in <i>G</i>.
                            </p>
                        	<p>
		                        We can represent the edges between each of the vertices representing the <i>n</i> papers in a database using an adjacency matrix. Below is an example illustration:

                                <br>
                            For two papers <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> to be considered <b>closely related</b>, there must be a path from the vertex corresponding to <i>p</i> to the one that corresponds to <i>q</i>. We define <b>distance</b> to be the shortest path from one vertex to another, where each edge has a uniform path cost of 1.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The two entries we chose are:

                                The second paper is referenced by the first, thus the distance is 1.

                                In a 3-D backbone structure, the protein design problem determines the optimal sequence of <i>n</i> rotamers (discretized protein side chains) that satisfies physical chemical potential functions and stereochemical constraints. This involves calculating the GMEC, global minimum energy conformation, by finding the sequence that minimizes the objective function representing the total energy. This is done by using a search graph over the conformational space. Current solutions have fallen into two groups: ones which approximate the GMEC, but can be trapped in local energy minimas and lead to a poor final solution; and ones that provide an exact solution, such as A*, but whose search spaces are too large. This 2016 paper from <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>, the journal of <i>Recomb</i>, proposes a modified AND/OR branch-and-bound search algorithm which solves the problem by getting rid of the rotamers known not to be part of the optimal solution. AND/OR is a search algorithm performed on a rooted tree that alternates between OR and AND nodes. Each OR node branches into different options represented by AND nodes, and each AND node branches into different possible outcomes as represented by OR nodes. The solution is a conditional plan, represented as a subtree that begins at the root, selects one AND child from each OR node, and includes every AND node's OR child that results in a goal leaf [1]. For this paper, each child node from an OR node specifies a rotamer from the residue. Each AND node branches into subspaces which represent separate residue total energies. The lowest energy conformation is determined suboptimally for an individual branch, and a global minimum energy is maintained based on the branches explored so far. The search proceeds depth-first, requiring only <i>n</i> mutable residues to be kept in memory at a time. If the minimum energy for a branch is greater than the temporary value kept for the global minimum energy, that part of the search space is pruned. The solution subtree represents a valid conformation. One combinatorial algorithm that can be applied to this kind of tree is bucket elimination, in which each node <i>c</i> that represents a rotamer would store the lower bound on the energy of its subtree, assuming the rotamers that are <i>c</i>'s ancestors in the tree representation. However, this requires some nodes to store large energy tables. Using a mini-bucket heuristic, through an algorithm that approximates bucket elimination, reduces the storage per node by allowing some of these energy tables to be broken up and split across two different nodes. Breaking the energy down to finer levels speeds up the heuristic so that larger trees can be processed. The algorithm was tested to be both space- and time-efficient in minimizing the energy conformation compared with other existing algorithms.

                                This was an interesting example of applying artificial intelligence to a biological problem. It incorporates a complete pipeline of mapping biological concepts onto a mathematical problem, surveying algorithmic solutions of varying complexities, discussing the mathematical complexity, making experimental verifications on biological data, and including additional computer hardware considerations. The end of the paper identifies opportunities for other researchers to speed up the run time even more and estimate bigger proteins by adding parallel processors. Providing the groundwork for future development is a strength.

                                However, as much of the argument depends on the relative complexity of their solution to other proposed methods, some necessary statistics about the operating space and time of other techniques are missing from the real biological experiment. The authors could strengthen their argument by going more precisely into the estimated run times of these existing techniques.

                            <h3>Background </h3>
                            <p> 
                                According to the definition from the American Psychological Association, a person who has social anxiety disorder (SAD) has exaggerated reactions in circumstances of perceived social judgment[1]. Due to an overactive limbic system and problems in emotion regulation, sufferers of social anxiety have a heightened response to threat, as shown through greater attention to negative facial and thought patterns[2]. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An emotion regulation task (ERT) is a standard task to test a subject’s ability to down-regulate a negative emotion[3]. In our study, we will examine data in which participants were asked to view one of two types of images: ones with no emotional stimulators (landscape, everyday activities, etc.), or ones with negative emotional stimulators (disasters, accidents, etc.). Upon being shown an image that corresponds to a negative emotion, participants were then asked to either maintain their negative emotions or try to reduce their negative emotions by re-interpreting the image.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The procured data is stored in brain network matrices, which we can apply network analysis techniques to. Network analysis involves analyzing the nodes on a graph, and determining the communities, or subgraphs, they belong to[4]. Properties like centrality, average path length, clustering coefficient and modularity are commonly used in network analysis. Research has shown that if brain damage, injury, disease or trauma causes edges or nodes to be removed, the more central these components are, the worse the implications may be for the rest of the brain[5]. This study will collect related parameters of network properties and extract network differences in activation patterns during ERT. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Motivation</h3>
                            <p>
                                SAD is a disorder with significant costs to professional and academic productivity[6]. Research using conventional fMRI imaging signal contrast has revealed that social anxiety patients are more easily affected by negative images and struggle to down-regulate negative emotions[7]. Moreover, sufferers of social anxiety disorder show stronger connections in the left amygdala than healthy controls do[3]. However, it remains unknown what the active patterns on a brain network scale are for SAD patients. Graph theory is a feasible approach to study the SAD brain network. Application of graph theory to the resting state network has uncovered disruptions in fMRI-based functional networks in anxiety patients. Analyzing the active patterns of the diseased brain network will provide a data-driven approach to gain understanding into the inner mechanism of the SAD brain on a whole-brain scale. Hopefully, this can provide insight into identifying brain regions of interest for SAD treatment and diagnosis. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Specific Aims </h3>
                            <p>
                                We aim to discover underlying patterns for the SAD brain during emotion regulation by analyzing electroencephalography (EEG)-based SAD networks during emotion regulation. We will explore global network properties such as clustering coefficient, average path length; and edge and nodal properties such as degree distribution, betweenness, and centrality. Our goal is to see whether performing existing techniques on this particular dataset will provide insights that reinforce or challenge previous findings.

                            <p>
                                EEG data was collected from twenty SAD patients and twenty demographically matched healthy subjects while performing the emotion regulation task. All tests were conducted under Dr. Heide Klumpp from the Mood and Anxiety Research Program at UIC. The test subjects' label and information have been erased under IRB protocol*. Prior to this study, each task scenario, for each test subject, was mapped onto a 34*34 matrix via a functional mapping algorithm Weighted Phase Lag Index[9]. 34 corresponds to the number of recording electrodes and each index is the strength of the connection between two channels (ranging from 0 to 1, see Figure 1 for example). Each subject's matrix is averaged over a 5-minute recording in which they viewed 20+ images, so the effects of any image that could have triggered exceptional responses are smoothed out. Every matrix can be converted into an undirected, weighted graph (see Figure 2 for an example graph representation of two selected electrodes).

                            <h4>2.  Research method </h4> 
                            <p>
                                In addition to the properties listed in our Specific Aims, we will also investigate a community property: modularity. For all the property analyses, we will use a Python library called NetworkX[10]. The Louvain method will be the prior approach for community detection. If the stability of Louvain is not ideal, we will test the Newman approach. Our immediate next steps are to better understand the capabilities of this library, and better understand the Newman paper[11], to figure out how to use the library to run the algorithm. We believe these steps will be non-trivial.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the parameter that is relevant to the data, for basic global properties, we may run standard statistical tests such as the t-test in R to see whether the graph properties suggest group differences, and two-way ANOVA to investigate the task-group interaction. We will use other nodal and community properties as unsupervised learning features, to see if we can detect any meaningful clusters. Overall, we will see whether social anxiety makes a difference in the grouping patterns formed in brain networks engaged under different tasks. Looking into these graph properties for the brain under the tasks will provide more insight into the overall network differences in emotion and cognitive processing of social anxiety patients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some visualization tools will be applied to assist in understanding the results. We will make chord graphs based on the electrode locations, both before and after each set of tasks, for each of the groups. The chord diagram has commonly been used for network analysis and has numerous libraries to support it[8]. We will investigate network differences in the brain between the before and after graphs due to the negative emotion task versus the neutral emotion task, for the sick patients versus the control group. We expect differences in the behaviors of the two test groups, but knowing how they perform differently on a network level will provide more insight into the neural activation of SAD patients, which will be meaningful for future treatment.

                            <br>
	Connectome is a comprehensive way of mapping the brain in a form of network <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/">(Human connectome prohjcect )</a> With the assistance of different imaging modalities, we are able to construct the brain network which will indicate structural connectivity or functional connectivity among regions of interest (ROI). Commonly, structural connectivity can be acquired via Diffusion Tensor Imaging(DTI). Numbers of fibers connecting 
	one region to another will be counted and used to illustrate the structural connection. Functional connectional mapping can be acheived using functional imaging approach such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG. There are various ways of creating the functional mapping using these two approaches and the mappings can be directed or undirected. Here we selected EEG signal for it's cheap price and highly protable recording system, suitable for task 
	based signal recording. Weighted Phase Lag Index(WPLI) is one of the undirected approach to summerize synchronicity of two channels using the Fourier transformed phase information[9]. As it is shown in the proposal, the functional matrix is undirected, weighted matrix where the value indicates the level of synchronicity of two channels.

                            <br>	
	One of the main diagnostic criterias for sicial anxiety disorder(SAD) are individuals who marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech)[10].  Some studies suggest that social anxiety biases the mind to focus more on threat and have difficulty disengaging from social threat [8]. In resting state SAD networks studies, functional connectivity was decreased in the motor and visual networks, increased in default mode network which has been suggested to be involved in episodic memory, and self-projection[11]. 
	Abnormality also discovered in the connectivity of the frontal cortex, which plays a role in perceiving what is going on in other people’s minds, at rest may lead to deficits in social perception [1]. Above network alternations contribute to the paitients incapable in regulating their emotion[12].
	Emotion Regulation Task is one of the classic tasks to train SAD paitients to down regulate the emotion by re-interpret the picture containing the negative stimulus[13]. Neutrual picture served as basline of the measurement, and looking at a negative picuture(maintain) is the pre-regulation contrast. The three stage system will help reseachers to find out if the subject has performance axiety on set (differences found from baseline level), affected by comorbidity of depression (only difference in looking at negative picture(maintain)), or unable to regulate emotion (only difference in repappraise). Viewing the network data of ERT will better assist clinicians to understand the brain function of SAD on a network level.

                            <b>Edge and Node Properties as Applied to the Brain</b>
                            <br>
                            Network analysis is concerned with the prominence of actors in a network, as represented by nodes. One such measure of prominence is centrality, which characterizes the number of edges that a node participates in [2]. In management research, for example, social network analysis is used to determine which actors are central enough to an organization that losing them could be detrimental [3].
A node is said to have betweenness centrality relative to two other nodes if it is on a path between those nodes. In brain networks, a hub is a node that participates in many interactions or can be demonstrated to exhibit betweenness by participating in many paths. In addition to nodes, edges can also exhibit betweenness, which can be used to determine modularity [4]. Analysis of centrality can let us know which edges or nodes could cause problems if they are deleted.

<b>Community Properties as Applied to the Brain</b>
<br>
A community -- or as we think of them for the brain, module -- is a subset of nodes that interacts more frequently with each other than with others [5]. Community identification could be considered a form of unsupervised learning, or clustering. The nodes within a community should be close together, while nodes from different communities should be as far apart as possible. Existing research has developed algorithms to identify communities by optimizing the distance between different modules [6]. Trying to minimize the number of communities identified in a network is NP-hard, so there are approximations such as the generalized Louvain algorithm, a modularity-based community detection algorithm based around edge centrality. The Louvain algorithm ranks edges by their tendency to send information throughout the network. More formally, it ranks each edge by its k-path centrality, which is the sum of the proportions of times that messages cross through that edge [7].
